## Game Logic

1. The game board consists of 16 cards, with 8 unique values, each appearing twice.
2. Players click on a card to flip it and reveal its value.
3. The goal is to find all matching pairs of cards with the least number of moves.
4. If two cards match, they remain flipped. If not, they are flipped back over after a short delay.
5. The game ends when all pairs are found.
